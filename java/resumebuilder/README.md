Apache POI is a Java library that can be used to create and modify Word and Excel documents. You can use it to create a resume by creating a new Word document and then inserting the necessary information and formatting it to match the desired resume format. Here's an example of how you could use Apache POI to create a simple resume:



This class is an example of a minimalistic approach, you can add more functionality to the class such as creating different types of resumes (e.g. functional, chronological, etc.), or add more fields or sections to the resume such as certifications, languages, or references.

You can also use an external library or framework to generate the resume, like Apache POI, to create a Word or PDF document, or use a template engine like Apache Velocity or Freemarker to generate the final document.
